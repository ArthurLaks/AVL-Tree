This repository represents my attempt to learn Common Lisp.  I did not get very far.  The furthest I got is the functional aspect of LISP, such as function pointers and lambda expressions.  As part of my attempt to learn the language, I made a series of programs in order to test my knowledge and reinforce my understanding of the language.  All of the programs simply define functions.  I divided them into two categries: those that use recursion and those that use iteration.  The only program that does not fit into this system of classification is Point.lisp, an attempt to implement encapsulation through closures.
